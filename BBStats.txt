K/9 vs K%
Neither of these are park/league/season adjusted, so only good measure of this season.
Use K% for directly comparing pitchers, because it measures % of batters, not % of outs.
You should also use K% with BB% in conjunction. The larger the spread between strikeout and walk rate, the more effective the pitcher.  Fangraph has K-BB% (higher number better).

K/9

IFFB	11%
“Ground ball pitchers” generally have grounder rates over 50%, while “fly ball pitchers” have fly ball rates above (or approaching) 40%.

(Use Statcast for GIDP)
Used GIDP/9 instead of GB% for players earlier than 2002
Grounded into double plays
gidp/9 > 1 == GB+

GB%:
Generally, ground ball pitchers will run higher BABIPs than average and fly ball pitchers will run lower BABIPs than average.
But you can't use it, because it is more geared towards results that are hits
For this stat, you want a pitcher who is good at causing double plays...

So I think you need to use FIP-:
The results were that the average ground ball generated 0.04 runs and caused 0.80 outs while the average ball in air generated 0.23 runs and caused just 0.62 outs. On a runs-per-out basis, balls hit into the air created almost 7.5 times as much offense as balls kept on the ground did.

ERA
Rating	ERA
Excellent	2.50
Great	3.00
Above Average	3.40

Below Average	4.00
Poor	4.30
Awful	4.60

Use FIP instead of ERA. (Fielding Independent Pitching)
measures the effectiveness of preventing HRs, BB, HBP, and causing SO
FIP is not league or park adjusted
FIP- is park and league adjusted (lower stat is better)
ERA- is league adjusted
Example:  87 ERA- is 13% points better than league avg
			110 ERA- is 10% points worse than league avg
FIP Scale:
Excellent		3.20
Great			3.50
Above Average	3.80
Average			4.20
Below Average	4.40
Poor			4.70
Awful			5.00

ERA-/FIP-/xFIP- Scale:
Excellent		70
Great			80
Above average	90
Average			100
Below average	110
Poor			115
Awful			125


For Control:
Use BB%

For speed -
Use BsR for later years
Also try UBR for later years
Rating		UBR
Excellent		+6
Great			+4
Above Average	+1.5
Average			0
Below Average	-1.5
Poor			-4
Awful			-6

For older years try wSB (weighted stolen bases):
it is neutral and not park/opponent adjusted.
0 is league average
player with +5 wSB has been worth five more runs than the average players given that player's stolen base activity
general values are -3 and +6
in later years, wSB is combined with UBR to produce BsR

Don't use Speed
