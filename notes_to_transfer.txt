Dai Ya the Scholar tells you, "Hello, I am a collector of the writings of Jhong Mi, who was a philosopher who wrote his own interpretations of the teachings of Jojii.  If you find any of his writings, please give them to me, and I will reward you. You might start by talking to Lou Ei at the North Outpost, or Te Ven at the South Outpost."
19:55:36 Dai Ya the Scholar tells you, "Also, I have been contracted by the Dereth Exploration Society to help them in their outreach program towards the Isparians who find themselves newly exiled in Dereth.  Here is a book that explains their mission.  I am also giving you a list describing the locations of the nearest stamp and portals to other towns.  If you collect any of the Society's stamped letters, you may bring them back to me for a reward."


The Olthoi Chasm quest is a series of increasingly difficult dungeons each with a note at the end. The goal of the quest is to retrieve a series of notes at the end of each dungeon and turn them in to Xavier, Royal Guard located on the surface by the entrance portal to the first dungeon.
Walkthrough
Optional: Buy a copy of the Olthoi Tunnels Rumor from Selflora the Barkeep in the Lytelthorpe bar.
The progressive dungeons are all different but have similar set ups. First you encounter Undead and Skeletons, and then in the later portion of the dungeons you encounter Olthoi. You can just run through the dungeons to the end and grab the notes if you wish.
To get to the first dungeon, go through the Facility Hub to the level 30 area and take the Haunted Mansion portal. Then run south to the entrance at 0.7N, 44.7E.
The entrance to the second dungeon is at the end of the first dungeon, and so on - be sure and pick up the note before you enter each portal.
There is no surface portal in this dungeon. Once you have all of the notes you can get, you have to recall and run all the way back to hand in the notes to the Royal Guard for the rewards.
Each dungeon is progressively harder. The final dungeon is extremely hard and you should be Level 200+ or have a large group of 150+.
There is an Exploration Marker just outside the dungeon portal, if you are so inclined.

Soul Hunter (13 days)
Talk to Hasin Lin at 28.9S, 59.3E, in Sawato.
Enter Soul Hunter's Lair at 27.7S, 55.8E.
Make your way to the end of the dungeon.
[OPTIONAL] If you wish, you can skip ahead in the dungeon by making a sacrifice. This is not required, and places a quest flag on your character as a Falatacot helper.
Pick up the Sacrificial Goblet and the Sacrificial Knife
Use the knife on the goblet to create a Filled Sacrificial Goblet.
Give the filled goblet to the Altar of Urdhinivix
You are now flagged to enter the Soul Hunter's Chambers, a shortcut portal that leads further into the dungeon.
Kill the Soul Hunter and loot the Soul Hunter's Untranslated Orders. It drops 1 per kill.
Bring this text to Fanzen San the Translator at 39.2S 81.6E, near Hebian-To, for translation and Soul Hunter's Orders.

Frozen Fury
Part 1: The Virindi Complex
Speak to Mage Syltyn Rillon near Glenden Wood at 27.8N, 24.7E to flag for the Virindi Complex.
Make your way to the complex at 73.8N, 25.1E.
Route: either take the East Esper Valley settlement portal from the Crater at 66.4N, 14.3E or run east from Neydisa Castle along Bandit Road until you reach a glowing tree where the note from Syltyn Rillon used to be, then simply run north to the portal.
From the drop, jump down each step and through the passage to more drops with a bridge overhead (used to exit the dungeon). After reaching the bottom head south until you reach two portals with another copy of A Tale of Paths.
Pick up the book if you didn't keep the original and want to find your own way through the complex.
The west portal follows Atlas' route and the east portal is Syretta's route from the story.
Part 2: Navigating the Portal Maze
We will follow Atlas' route, so head west into the portal and you will appear in a room with four portals, from here take the west portal again to end up in a room with 8 portals.
Now take the east portal in the middle into a room with 4 portals lined up in a row.
Take the last portal to the east of the row and then in the next room take either of the middle portals.
You should now be in a room with a red moving light and two portals.
Take the west portal and then east in the next room with 4 portals.
If you succesfully traversed the portal rooms you will fall through some mysterious lights into the next section. Go into the portal in the middle of the room.
Head around the caged lighting area and down the passage to the left.
Ignore all side passages and stick to the main path and you should come to a ledge with a flame in the center leading up into the ceiling. Jump down off the ledge to the left and head north - the next part is fairly linear and leads up and around platforms suspended in the air with crystals.
As you head up go east past the area that contains what looks like cells for experiments. You should now be in a room with a single platform in the middle with a Virindi Executor on top of it. The Virindi Interrogators here drop the Virindi Signet.
The exit portal leads to the bridges mentioned earlier which cross over into a room with the surface portal.
Bring the signet back to Mage Syltyn Rillon to be flagged to remove the Sword of Frozen Fury at 29.6N, 27.4E. The sword can also be given to Omaro Nagate near Glenden Wood (30.0N, 25.8E) for the Dagger of Frozen Fury.


Voracious Eater Kill Task
Talk to Aun Ruperea at 44.3N 77.9W in Timaru to begin the task of killing 50 Voracious Eaters.


Crystalline Crag
Route
Use the Portal to Izji Qo's Temple at your allegiance mansion and then run to 14.6S, 62.2W.
If you don't have access to a mansion device then you have a bit of a run:
Start by purchasing some Sake from a Sho Barkeep.
Then you need to go to the Drunken Madman:
You can either run from Baishi to the Drunken Madman at 53.0S, 61.0E, -- OR --
You can take a shortcut if you have access to Ayan Baqur -- give Ulgrim the Unpleasant the Sake and he'll open a portal for you to the Madman (Ulgrim doesn't keep the Sake).
Give the Madman the Sake and use the gateway to Walled Portals he summons.
From Walled Portals, take the Outside Accursed Halls Portal. Climb the wall to the North, jump outside, and proceed to the Resonant Portal at 14.6S 62.2W.
