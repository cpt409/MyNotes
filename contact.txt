Sai-Fon (female name given to bruce lee when born, to ward off evil spirits from taking away a male child).

Jun-Fan: bruce lee later renamed this, means "Return Again".



using no way, as way
having no limitation, as a limitation

i doesn't mean that anything you do is okay.
it means to not be boxed in to a set idealogy/system/style.

do not presuppose a way, be in the moment, be present,
	be open to the best way to meet the moment.
do not limit yourself or your thinking
do not let your beliefs or your style limit your experience

must be free mentally and physically to express yourself however you must.
if you commit to political style, then you begin defending it and therefore become limited.
truth is outside of all patterns.

absorb what is useful,
	discard what is not,
	add what is uniquely your own.

if you follow the classical pattern,
	you are understanding the routine,
	the tradition, the shadow --
	you are not understanding yourself

there is not help better than self help



Worked 3 normal hours and 1.5 OT hours on Sunday 6/28/2020.  Originally captured the hours as 4.5 normal hours.




5 things I am not:

- I am not an expert.  I don't claim to know everything.  I'm more of a jack-of-all-trades. 

- I am not a hero/glory hog.  I don't do things to get awards, attention, or to look better than other people.

- I am not a potatoe.  Hardly anything thing gets done without the help of others.  I believe in teamwork and ensuring everybody on the team is accounted for when working on projects.

- I am not opionated.  I generally listen to everybody around me and go with the team plan and ideas.

- I am not afraid to ask for help.

Favorite Dr:  Peter Capaldi.  If we go back to why the regeneration process chose that face, it was to remind him to try to save people, regardless of the consequences.

The reason I like him the most is because he is kinda like that paternal type of figure, although not overboard.  I meean, regardless of our age, I think people are always looking for somebody to look to for wisdom and guidance.  Even if at the same time being kinda abrupt and matter-of-fact.

Favorite show:  Christmas Special 2008 (David Tennant).  "The Next Doctor".   Jackson Lake mishandles an Info Stamp, and it backfires a bunch of information about Time Lords into him.

It teachs us that sometimes we can lose who we really are, especially when overcome with fear and despair.  He uses the info stamp in an effort to protect his family, and it does destroy the cyberman in his basement, but it also backfires and fills his mind with information about all of the Doctors.



Hi Sir/Ma'am,

It would be an excessive amount of effort us to move this to the room where we need it, and then unbox and set the unit up only to find out that there are problems with it, or that we are not happy with the condition of it.  I am also concerned that moving it around might cause additional damage.

We would prefer to be refunded, and to have the unit returned.  Is this an option?

Very Respectfully,
Chris

I hope all is well with you both.  My name is Chris Trimmer, and I have a quick question about a letter that I am just now seeing.

It states that I have an overdue portion of child support that may be referred to STROP. 

I was hoping to verify if this amount is accurate.  The date of the letter is March 27, 2020 and it says the amount is $178.71, however I made a payment of $518.00 on March 30, 2020 as part of my monthly payment.  At that time I wasn't aware of an overdue amount, so my apologies for missing any overdue amount.

I called in to the phone system to verify if I had anything overdue, and the system said that I didn't.

If at all possible, I'm would like to avoid anything getting sent to STROP. 

What is the best way for me to remedy this?

I sincerely appreciate your help!

V/R,
Chris
